						<h4>Bridge</h4>
						<p>A bridge is designed to provide a patient, who is missing a tooth or teeth in the same area of the mouth, the opportunity to have a false tooth made to fill the existing space. This is done by crowning the teeth on the either side of the space and attaching a false tooth/teeth to the crowns.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4">
					<div class="grid1">
						<h4>Crowns</h4>
						<p>A crown can be made from either gold or porcelain and is a cap that is specially designed to cover a tooth. Teeth are generally crowned for: the tooth may have fractured or a considerable amount of the tooth is filling leaving the tooth weak and susceptible to further breakage.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4">
					<div class="grid1">
						<h4>Dentures</h4>
						<p>The use of dentures is an easy way of replacing missing teeth, and is a lot more affordable than implant or bridge work. We are able to construct dentures for single tooth replacement, partial tooth loss, or replacement of all teeth. Dentures are constructed during a few visits to our practice. </p>

					<div class="grid1">
						<h4>Filling</h4>
						<p>gradually construct a denture to suit every patient's individual needs Filling is a tooth retaining (conservative) treatment to restore the crown or the root destruction of the tooth (mostly caused by caries and trauma). Thanks to the continuous development of technology, nowadays the once popular amalgam fillings are mostly replaced by aesthetic fillings.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4">
					<div class="grid1">
						<h4>Implants</h4>
						<p>We have introduced a new technology to minimize discomfort and healing times when using and installing implants. The gum is not cut, meaning that there is almost no swelling or damage; therefore the patient will only experience minimal discomfort. In addition, the implants we use are high-tech German-made single units. </p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4">
					<div class="grid1">
						<h4>Teeth Whitening</h4>
						<p>Teeth whitening can be done in two different methods: (1) the home whitening system, prepared in our dental office and completed by you at home; and (2) an in-office whitening system which is completed in one visit. The in-office tooth whitening system uses a whitening solution that is stronger than the home whitening solution. </p>
